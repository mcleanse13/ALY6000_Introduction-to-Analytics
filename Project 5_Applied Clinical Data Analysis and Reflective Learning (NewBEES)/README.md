Project Overview: Clinical Outcome Exploration and R Learning Reflection Using Regression and Visualization

This project represents the culmination of my work within the NewBEES learning group for ALY 6000. It integrates a reflection on the process of mastering R programming with applied statistical analysis of clinical data. The analytical portion explores relationships among tumor size, inpatient days, age, and gender through scatter plots, boxplots, and descriptive statistics. The accompanying written report reflects on the learning experience gained through the NewBEES collaboration, emphasizing the value of deliberate, methodical coding practice and confidence-building through applied projects.

Methods and Tools:

The analysis utilizes R and the ggplot2 package to visualize data and perform exploratory data analysis. Key tasks include computing measures of central tendency and dispersion (mean and standard deviation), performing linear regression, and visualizing outcomes through scatter plots and boxplots. Plots are enhanced with jittering, color differentiation by gender, and aesthetic customization to improve clarity.

Key Learning Objectives:

- Develop a step-by-step approach to interpreting R code for deeper understanding.

- Apply regression modeling and data visualization to examine clinical outcomes.

- Enhance presentation of analytical results using effective visual design.

- Foster confidence in coding through peer collaboration and reflective learning.

Summary of Findings:

Through regression and visualization, the analysis indicates a positive association between tumor size and inpatient recovery days, suggesting that larger tumor sizes may correspond with longer hospital stays. Boxplots and jittered visualizations highlight the variation in inpatient days across genders, providing insight into potential demographic differences in outcomes. From a learning perspective, this project underscores the importance of pacing, collaboration, and engagement with personally meaningful data to strengthen analytical proficiency and confidence.

Reflection:

The reflective component identifies how deliberate practice—slowing down to analyze each line of code—leads to improved comprehension and reduced anxiety in data analysis tasks. Working with familiar and engaging data, such as baseball statistics earlier in the course, reinforced the connection between passion and learning efficacy, ultimately shaping a more confident and intentional approach to data science.
