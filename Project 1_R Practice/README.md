📘 Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental R programming concepts through vector manipulation, mathematical computation, data transformation, and visualization. It includes both an R script and a PDF report summarizing findings, outputs, and visualizations based on the provided project instructions.

The assignment also utilizes the tidyverse and testthat packages for data wrangling, visualization, and automated testing of R code.

🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

Arithmetic and logical operations

Creating and manipulating vectors (c(), seq(), rep(), :)

Subsetting and indexing with brackets and logical vectors

Using built-in functions (sum, mean, median, max, min)

Generating random data with runif() and rnorm()

Computing summary statistics and cumulative sums

Data manipulation with dplyr (select, filter, mutate, arrange, slice)

Visualization with ggplot2

Automated testing with testthat

📊 Data Exploration

Later parts of the project use ds_salaries.csv.
Key steps include:

Reading data with read_csv()

Creating subsets with select() and filter()

Computing derived columns (e.g., salary conversions)

Visualizing job titles vs. salary with ggplot()
